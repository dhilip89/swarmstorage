Intelligence
============

Swarmstorage node includes full knowledge and abilities to:

  - serve client requests
  - serve maintainance requests
  - contact neighbours
  - gather information
  - make decision

With these characters, the whole domain cluster can run correctly without centralized control structure dictating how individual nodes should behave. Such nodes are called smart nodes, owning basic intelligence.

But distributed system environment is very complex and unpredictable, nodes need to be more intelligent to handle bad situations to make whole system works more robust and smooth. Belowing are some ideas may be added to nodes:

  - remembering
  - control feedback loop
